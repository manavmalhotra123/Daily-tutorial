// CLASSES 
/*
structure: system defined data-type template that stores data of different type of 
           data-types. # use of typedef: to give a sort of nick name to the structure.

why classes if we have structures??
- because the data hiding is not possible in case of structure
- functions can not be used in the structures.
- cannot handle real world problems
- used to insert data only

syntax of class:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
class name_of_class
{
private:
    ( data )
public:
    name_of_class( args );
    ~name_of_class();
};

name_of_class::name_of_class( args )
{
}

name_of_class::~name_of_class()
{
} */

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
// defining the class
class employee // name of the classs : 'employee'
{
     private:
           int a,b,c;

     public:
           int d ,e;   // public variables that can be defined publically
           void setdata(int a,int b,int c); // declaration of the function that will include in class
           
           // declaration and defining of the function 
           void getdata(){
            cout<<"the value of a is "<<a<<endl;
            cout<<"the value of b is "<<b<<endl;
            cout<<"the value of c is "<<c<<endl;
            cout<<"the value of d is "<<d<<endl;
            cout<<"the value of e is "<<e<<endl;
           }

};

// defining the class function outside the class
void employee ::setdata(int a1, int b1, int c1){
    a=a1;
    b=b1;
    c=c1;
}
int main(){
    // making object of the class 'employee'
    employee coder;
    coder.d=34; // assigning the value to the global variable d
    coder.setdata(1,2,4);// assigning the values to a1 , b1 , c1
    coder.getdata();// it will help to get the displayed output as defined in the function
    /*  OUTPUT
     the value of a is 1
     the value of b is 2
     the value of c is 4
     the value of d is 34
     the value of e is 9180096 (as variable not assigned with any value so it will give 
                                   garbage value)
    */
    coder.e=45;
    coder.getdata(); // here the garbage value of variable e will be eliminated and value 45 will assigned to it

    /* like in python here we cannot define every variable in main function directly . the private variables can 
    only be accesed by using the function defined in private section of the class */

    // but the public variables can be defined anywhere in the program
    return 0;
}

// A SUMMARY OF CLASS AND OBJECTS
 // CLASSES AND OBJECTS:

    // C++ -----> initially called ----> C with classes by strousstroup
    // classes ----> extensions of structures.
    // structures had limitation 
                           //----> members are public    
    // classes ---. structures + more 
    // classes can have methods and properties.
    // classes can make few members as private as well as public
    // classes in C++ are typedef
    // you can declare objects along with the class declaration
       /*  class employee{};
           coder,manav,anmol;    (it is the declaratio of the objects)
       */
    // coder.salary = 456; give error if the variable salary is private variable
